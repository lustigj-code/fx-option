# Feature Specification: Implement secure authentication and role-based access for portal and admin with compliance audit coverage

**Feature Branch**: `[003-implement-secure-authentication]`  
**Created**: 2025-08-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement secure authentication and role-based access for portal and admin with compliance audit coverage"

## Executive Summary *(mandatory)*
- **Goal**: Provide secure sign-in, session management, and role-based access control across portal and admin interfaces, ensuring compliance auditability and access logs.
- **Primary Users**: Treasury managers, risk analysts, compliance officers, administrators.
- **Success Criteria**:  
  - Users can authenticate via NextAuth (credentials/demo now, modular for SSO).  
  - Role-based gating restricts access and surfaces unauthorized attempts.  
  - MFA flows (or placeholders) introduced for compliance-critical routes.  
  - All auth events and privileged actions are logged via audit chain.
- **Surfaces Impacted**: `portal`, `admin`, `services/gateway`, `docs/compliance`, `services/audit`.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A treasury manager signs into the portal using secure credentials, navigates permitted routes, and is denied access to admin-only features with clear messaging and audit logging.

### Secondary Stories
- A compliance officer logs into the admin interface, reviews audit logs, and confirms MFA enrollment.  
- An unauthorized user attempts to access restricted routes and receives a security alert while their attempt is logged.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid user credential, **When** they sign in via NextAuth form, **Then** the session is created, scoped to their role, and recorded in the audit trail.  
2. **Given** a user lacking admin role, **When** they access admin routes, **Then** they see an access denied page, and an alert is recorded for compliance.

### Edge & Failure Cases
- Session expires → user is redirected to login, state preserved, event logged.  
- MFA required but not configured → display enrollment flow and block access until resolved.  
- Account locked due to repeated failures → lockout message, support contact, audit entry.

## Functional Requirements *(mandatory)*
- **FR-001**: System MUST support secure authentication with NextAuth and pluggable providers, configurable for production SSO.  
- **FR-002**: Portal MUST enforce route-level gating and hide unauthorized navigation items based on role claims.  
- **FR-003**: Admin MUST enforce stricter roles (compliance, ops) and log escalations on unauthorized access attempts.  
- **FR-004**: Audit service MUST capture sign-in, sign-out, failed attempts, role CHANGES, and privileged actions.  
- **FR-005**: UI MUST provide MFA enrollment/verification UX (or placeholder with server support) and display compliance banners.  
- **FR-006**: Services MUST protect API endpoints with token validation, scope checks, and structured logging.

## Data & Contract Considerations *(optional)*
- Define JWT payload structure, role claims, and session expiry.  
- Document MFA tokens, backup codes, and storage strategy.  
- Ensure audit events include user ID, role, source, timestamp.

## UX & Content Notes *(optional)*
- UI should present accessible login forms, error messages, and guidance for MFA.  
- Admin interface needs role management dashboards and escalation cues.

## Risk & Controls *(mandatory when workflows touch compliance or trading)*
- Lockout procedures for repeated failed attempts, escalations to compliance.  
- Session handling meets policy (timeout, device management).  
- All privileged actions require dual control or logging for review.

## Rollout & Metrics *(optional)*
- Staged rollout: credentials + MFA placeholders for demo, migrate to SSO later.  
- Track metrics: sign-in success rate, failed attempts, unauthorized access alerts, MFA adoption.
