# CTA & IB Client Disclosures (Plain-English Summary)

## Key Risks You Should Understand

- **Trading futures and options is speculative.** You can lose more than the cash you deposit because losses may exceed margin in volatile markets.
- **Past performance is not a guarantee.** Our historical track records are provided for context only and do not predict future results.
- **Leverage amplifies outcomes.** Small market moves can create large profits or losses due to the leverage embedded in futures and options.
- **Liquidity can disappear.** In stressed markets, it may be hard or impossible to exit positions without significant price impact.
- **Electronic systems may fail.** Platform outages, cybersecurity incidents, or connectivity issues could delay or prevent trade execution.
- **Regulatory changes may impact strategies.** New rules or exchange actions can restrict products, raise margin, or require position reductions.

## How We Manage Your Account

- **Discretionary authority.** We will place trades on your behalf in line with your signed advisory agreement and investment profile.
- **Strategies used.** Our primary focus is systematic currency options with defined risk controls, supplemented by opportunistic futures hedges.
- **Use of third parties.** Clearing and custody services are provided by an unaffiliated FCM. We conduct due diligence on each vendor annually.
- **Reporting.** You will receive daily statements directly from the FCM and monthly strategy commentary from us.

## Fees & Expenses

- **Management fee.** 2% per year, billed monthly in arrears based on month-end net asset value.
- **Incentive fee.** 20% of new net profits, calculated quarterly with a high-water mark.
- **Trading costs.** You are responsible for commissions, exchange fees, regulatory fees, and give-up fees charged by the FCM or exchanges.
- **Other expenses.** We may pass through reasonable research data costs that directly benefit your account after advance notice.

## Conflicts of Interest

- We and our employees may trade for our own accounts. We maintain pre-trade clearance and post-trade monitoring to address conflicts.
- Our incentive fee could motivate us to take more risk. To mitigate this, we adhere to risk limits and supervisory reviews detailed in our procedures manual.
