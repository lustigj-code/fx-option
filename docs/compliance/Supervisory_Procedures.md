# Supervisory Procedures Manual

These procedures support our obligations as a Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and Introducing Broker (IB) candidate. They outline how management supervises personnel, monitors trading, handles customer interactions, and responds to regulatory requests.

## 1. Governance Structure

- **Chief Compliance Officer (CCO).** Jane Smith oversees the compliance program, approves policies, and serves as primary regulator contact.
- **Chief Executive Officer (CEO).** Robert Lee ensures adequate resources and signs supervisory certifications.
- **Supervisory Committee.** Comprised of the CCO, Head Trader, and Operations Manager. Meets monthly and ad hoc as needed.
- **Escalation chain.** Employees report concerns to their direct supervisor; unresolved issues escalate to the CCO within 24 hours and to the CEO if compliance cannot resolve.

## 2. Registration & Licensing Supervision

- Maintain a register of all associated persons, including Form 8-R status, fingerprint dates, and exam completions.
- Run quarterly audits to confirm active NFA registration and state-level requirements where applicable.
- Track continuing education deadlines and obtain annual attestations from each AP.

## 3. Sales & Communication Oversight

- **Advertising review.** Compliance pre-approves all promotional materials, pitch decks, and website updates before publication.
- **Correspondence monitoring.** Archive all business emails and instant messages in the compliance archive. Review a 10% sample monthly for accuracy and fair dealing.
- **Disclosure delivery.** Confirm each prospect receives `Disclosures.md` and the full CTA Disclosure Document before account opening. Maintain signed acknowledgments.
- **Telemarketing controls.** Reference Do Not Call registries and maintain call logs for five years.

## 4. Account Onboarding & Suitability

- Require completed account application, advisory agreement, W-9/W-8, identification documents, and investment profile questionnaire.
- Perform know-your-customer (KYC) checks, including sanctions screening and beneficial ownership verification.
- CCO reviews suitability determinations for all discretionary accounts prior to first trade.
- Document risk tolerance and ensure strategies align with each client's objectives.

## 5. Trading Supervision

- **Pre-trade controls.** Automated limits flag orders exceeding approved position sizes or risk budgets. Compliance receives real-time alerts.
- **Daily review.** Head Trader prepares a blotter summary each morning covering prior-day fills, open positions, margin usage, and exceptions.
- **Exception handling.** Material breaches of limits trigger immediate trade halts and written incident reports within four hours.
- **Allocation policy.** Trades are allocated pro rata based on account mandate. Deviations require documented rationale and CCO approval.
- **Give-up agreements.** Operations maintains an inventory of active give-ups and reviews expiration dates quarterly.

## 6. Risk Management Monitoring

- Calculate value-at-risk (VaR) and stress tests daily; escalate breaches of risk appetite to the Supervisory Committee.
- Margin calls are addressed within required deadlines; failure to meet calls results in liquidation pursuant to FCM agreements.
- Conduct quarterly scenario analyses focusing on currency crises, volatility spikes, and counterparty defaults.

## 7. Operations & Financial Controls

- Reconcile customer statements to internal records daily. Differences over $100 require documented investigation.
- Segregate duties between trade entry, reconciliation, and cash movement approvals.
- Wire transfers require dual authorization (initiator plus approver) and callback verification with clients.
- Maintain books and records per CFTC/NFA retention schedules, minimum five years with first two years readily accessible.

## 8. Complaint Handling

- Log all complaints in the Compliance Register with date, client, issue summary, and resolution steps.

- Provide written resolution or status update within 10 business days. Escalate unresolved matters to the Supervisory Committee.

## 9. Regulatory Inquiries

- Notify the CCO immediately upon receiving any regulator request or subpoena.
- CCO coordinates document collection, reviews responses with counsel, and submits via secure channels.
- Track deadlines in the Regulatory Response Log and conduct post-mortem reviews after closure.

## 10. Business Continuity & Cybersecurity Oversight

- Conduct annual tabletop exercises covering trading disruptions, data breaches, and pandemic scenarios.
- IT maintains patch management logs; compliance reviews quarterly.
- Employees must report suspected cyber incidents immediately to IT and the CCO. Implement incident response plan within one hour of detection.

## 11. Annual Review & Testing

- CCO performs an annual review of supervisory controls, documenting findings and remediation timelines.
- Independent testing by external counsel occurs at least every two years.
- Present annual report to senior management and retain minutes reflecting discussion and approvals.

## 12. Recordkeeping & Attestations

- Supervisors submit quarterly certifications confirming adherence to these procedures.
